          Joined as a technical co-founder and first full-time engineer. Took ownership of existing web application from outsourced team and continued to iterate, improve, and add functionality as we scaled and prepared for mobile expansion. I recruited and hired our first full-time mobile engineer and pushed to use Apple's new Swift programming language. While continuing development on the web, we launched a feature-complete iOS application in less than six months. Two months after launching, we completely refreshed the mobile UI/experience - resulting in promotion in the <em>Best New Apps</em> and <em>Health &amp; Fitness</em> categories in the Apple App Store.
