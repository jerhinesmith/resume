        <p>
          For the past 3 years, I've held various roles at Kabam.  These roles have ranged from primarily engineering to a mix of engineering and management.  Having already built and launched several products using ruby and rails at my previous company, I was hired at Kabam to help launch a brand new game on Facebook's platform.  During this period, I dramatically improved my skills in ruby, rails, mysql, redis, and node.  Additionally, as the game expanded to multiple platforms, I gained experience in scaling and api integration.  Primarily based on the success I had stabilizing performance and shipping several large features, I was promoted to Senior Engineering Manager and charged with leading both frontend and backend on two successful web games.  In this role, I reversed a downward revenue trajectory, stabilized engineering turnover, and instilled a team culture that increased morale and job satisfaction.  On the technical side, I also increased performance and throughput on a game that serves over 180,000 requests per minute.

          While at Kabam, I realized that I really enjoy building "things".  3 years ago, I would have said these "things" are primarily technical tasks.  I've always enjoyed digging deep into a problem and eventually coming up with a solution that scales and provides a solid foundation for future changes.  After spending over a year managing two different engineering teams, I've realized that building a team can be just as challenging and rewarding as building a product.  I enjoy mentoring junior engineers and guiding them toward simpler and cleaner solutions.  I was heavily involved in recruiting and hiring both junior and senior engineers, and I used that experience to build a very strong team and culture.  That said, I also really enjoy the days where I can put on headphones and hack on a new feature or idea.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking forward to my next role, I'm hoping to leverage my 5+ years of rails experience and 3+ years of engineering management experience to build something new and interesting.  I get really excited about solving difficult problems;  these can often be overwhelming, but I think that's what makes them so appealing.
