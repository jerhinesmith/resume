        <p>
          I moved to the bay area and started at Kabam about 3 years ago.  At Kabam, I helped launch a web-based game on Facebook, Google+, and our own platform, Kabam.com.  After spending several months primarily coding, I was promoted to lead backend engineer where I stabalized performance and helped ship several large features.  Eventually I was promoted to Senior Engineering Manager - leading both the frontend and backend on two successful web games.  In this role, I reversed a downward revenue trajectory, stabalized engineering turnover, and instilled a team culture that increased morale and job satisfaction.
        </p>

          While at Kabam, I realized that I really enjoy building "things".  3 years ago, I would have said these "things" are primarily technical tasks.  I've always enjoyed digging deep into a problem and eventually coming up with a solution that scales and provides a solid foundation for future changes.  After spending over a year managing two different engineering teams, I've realized that building a team can be just as challenging and rewarding as building a product.  I enjoy mentoring junior engineers and guiding them toward simpler and cleaner solutions.  I was heavily involved in recruiting and hiring both junior and senior engineers, and I used that experience to build a very strong team and culture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking forward to my next role, I'm hoping to take the experience I've had in building products and teams and apply it at a much earlier stage.  I get really excited about building solutions, and I'm looking for an opportunity to feel overwhelmed by a set of problems and excited by their opportunities.
